We recently wrapped up Solidity Summit with a bang and have one last announcement before the end of the year!

The [Solidity Developer Survey](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/pV-DdryeJoYUWvW+gXsFaMNynEY7t5mUsgeD1urgwSE/) for the year 2023 is live! We would love to collect your feedback and insights regarding Solidity!

**📝 [TAKE THE SURVEY!](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/pV-DdryeJoYUWvW+gXsFaMNynEY7t5mUsgeD1urgwSE/) 📝**

You can find the previous results of the Solidity Developer Survey 2022 [here](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/03/10/solidity-developer-survey-2022-results/). In 2022, a total of 1401 developers from 100 different countries participated in the survey out of which 41% used Solidity daily, and 37.3% weekly.

## About the Survey 🪄

Over the past three years, the survey has paved the way for language and compiler improvements and has helped us in shaping the future roadmap of Solidity.

Your response is invaluable for the Solidity project to understand your needs and the current strengths and weaknesses of the language. In addition, they will contribute towards establishing development priorities for the future. This will ultimately result in improving the Solidity developer experience as a whole.

The survey consists of several questions that can be categorised based on the following:

- Demographics
- Developer & User Profile
- Solidity Background
- Solidity Developer Experience
- Language Design
- Solidity Developer Community

Completing the survey will roughly require 10 minutes of your time.

And last but not the least, we made a conscious choice for our survey last year to move away from Google forms and will continue to use CryptPad as an open-source, encrypted, and self-hosted alternative that allows you to submit your responses fully anonymously (client-side encryption).

## Spread the Word! 📯

This marks the fourth time we are conducting a structured developer survey for Solidity devs and users. We would love to reach even more developers this year, so **please help us share the survey in your networks and reach the right audience!**

Stay tuned on [Solidity Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang)/[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@solidity) for the announcement regarding the survey results that will be shared on this blog in Q1 of 2024.

Thank you for your support!
