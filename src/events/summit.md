## Thank you for joining Solidity Summit 2023!

Solidity Summit 2023 was part of the [Devconnect week](https://devconnect.org/) and took place on Thursday, November 16, 2023. With roughly 300 participants, the event was well attended.

The day was packed with 15+ sessions on:

- Solidity internals and tips & tricks
- Solidity tooling
- Smart contract testing & security best practices
- EVM Languages and mechanisms
  ... and more!

The full agenda of the day is displayed below. You can watch all talks by browsing through the individual videos in the [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX8x7Zj6VeznJuVkZtRyKwseJdrr4mNsE&si=0j2Nr6x1UKu6A-MU) or in the [StreamETH archive](https://app.streameth.org/devconnect/solidity_summit/archive).

## More about Solidity Summit

The Solidity Summit is a collaborative event focusing on the future of [Solidity](/), featuring discussions and talks on Solidity, Yul, language design, security, tooling, and more.

During the event, you can expect to:

- Get up to speed with the latest language proposals and new features.
- Hear updates from Solidity tooling and security experts.
- Learn from Solidity power users.

We aim to have useful discussions that result in language improvement proposals and, ultimately in actual implementations. Furthermore, we want to foster communication between teams working on similar topics and identify needs for the smart contract ecosystem of Ethereum.

The Solidity Summit is a one-day forum for the Solidity ecosystem. It is for all people involved and interested in the Solidity language and the tooling around it.

## Who is Solidity Summit for?

The Solidity Summit focuses on advanced Solidity users and other stakeholders of the Solidity ecosystem, such as tool builders, auditors, and security researchers.

#### Solidity Language Shapers

Experts in Solidity, or other EVM smart contract languages, can share updates, or present improvement ideas and their thoughts.

#### Tooling Builders & Auditors

IDE developers, debuggers, analysis tools, or testing frameworks can use this occasion to share updates with the audience.

#### Solidity Enthusiasts

Seasoned Solidity users can share their finest Solidity hacks, tips, and comments!
