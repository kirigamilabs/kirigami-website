## Events (currently not implemented)

Front matter from markdown files contained within `/src/events` is used to populate event cards, using the following interface:

```ts
interface EventFrontmatter {
  title: string
  location: string
  startDate: string
  endDate: string
  imageSrc?: string
  previewLinks?: Link[]
  ctaLinks?: Link[]
  youtube?: string
  coordsOverride?: [Lat, Long]
  mapLabel?: string
}

// where...
interface Link {
  label: string
  href: string
}
type Lat = number
type Long = number
```

(See [src/interfaces.ts](src/interfaces.ts) for canonical `EventFrontmatter` interface.)

The date properties `startDate` and `endDate` are used to display recent events and next upcoming events on the homepage.

### Optional front matter properties for events

- `imageSrc` is the relative path to the image asset to be used as the hero banner.
- `previewLinks` are used to display button links on the event _preview_ cards shown on the homepage. It accepts a list of `Link` objects, each with a `label` and `href`.
- `ctaLinks` are call-to-action button links displayed in the hero and bottom of an event _page_. The first one listed will be styled as a primary solid button; any additional will be styled as a secondary outline button. It accepts a list of `Link` objects, each with a `label` and `href`.
- `youtube` accepts a YouTube video link or video ID, and embeds it below the hero of the event page. It accepts any of the following formats:
  - Standard format: `https://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567890`
  - Embed format: `https://www.youtube.com/embed/1234567890`
  - Shortened format: `https://youtu.be/1234567890`
  - Just the video ID: `1234567890`
- `coordsOverride` can be used to provide a latitude and longitude to override the map location being rendered. See below for more info.
- `mapLabel` can be provided to customize the `<h2>` label shown before an embedded map.

### Location and embedded map

The `location` property is used to display a map on the event page, fetched from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). If the resulting location is inaccurate or not precise enough, `coordsOverride` can optionally be provided to override this result. If no results are found, the map will not be displayed.

For virtual/remote events, use `location: Remote`, and the map will not be displayed.

_Note: Package `leaflet-geosearch` is being used for geocoding. Using older version `3.6.1` intentionally to avoid the addition of an unnecessary Google dependency added in later versions._

### Event example (currently not implemented)

```md
---
title: Solidity Summit 2023
location: Istanbul, Turkey
startDate: 2023-11-16
endDate: 2023-11-16
imageSrc: /assets/solidity_summit_2023.png
ctaLinks:
  - label: Speak
    href: https://link.to.speaker.application
  - label: Attend
    href: https://link.to.attendee.application
previewLinks:
  - label: Join us
    href: /event/solidity-summit-2023/
---

Intro text

## First header as h2

...
```

### Event example using `coordsOverride`

```md
---
title: Solidity Summit 2023
location: Istanbul, Turkey
startDate: 2023-11-16
endDate: 2023-11-16
imageSrc: /assets/solidity_summit_2023.png
ctaLinks:
  - label: Speak
    href: https://link.to.speaker.application
  - label: Attend
    href: https://link.to.attendee.application
previewLinks:
  - label: Join us
    href: /event/solidity-summit-2023/
coordsOverride:
  - 41.0082
  - 28.9784
---

Intro text

## First header as h2

...
```

Note that `coordsOverride` is a tuple of two numbers, representing latitude and longitude, respectively. Positive numbers represent north and east, while negative represent south and west.

## Blog entries (pending conversion to Product entries)

- Blog posts should be markdown files, stored in the `/src/posts` folder
- Filename must take the pattern of `YYYY-MM-DD-chosen-post-title.md`
- Front matter should take the shape of the following interface:

  ```ts
  interface BlogPostFrontmatter {
    layout?: string
    title: string
    date: string
    author: string
    category: Category
  }
  ```

  (See [src/interfaces.ts](src/interfaces.ts) for canonical `BlogPostFrontmatter` interface.)

- `Category` must take one of the following values:

  - `Releases`
  - `Security Alerts`
  - `Announcements`
  - `Explainers`

  (See [src/constants.ts](src/constants.ts) and [src/interfaces.ts](src/interfaces.ts) for canonical `Category` enum.)

- `title` property will be displayed automatically as an `<h1>` (`#` in markdown), and should not be included in the markdown bodyâ€”start document header levels from `<h2>` (`##`)
- `date` property should be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- MDX/JSX is not currently supported
- Images can be placed in a corresponding folder within `/public/img` and references using `![alt text](/img/chosen-folder/image-name.png)`

### Blog post example

```md
---
title: 'Solidity 0.8.20 Release Announcement'
date: '2023-05-10'
author: Solidity Team
category: Releases
---

Intro text

## First header as h2

...
```

## Adding internal links (example based on Solidity Lang blog posts)

When linking to content internal to this repo, relative paths should be used instead of absolute paths. This ensures proper routing with Next.js, and avoids unintentional page refreshes.

This includes links to blog posts, which now live under https://soliditylang.org/blog/ and should be referenced using `/blog/YYYY/MM-DD/post-name/`, _without_ `https://soliditylang.org`.

This does NOT include links to the docs, which are located at a different subdomain of https://docs.soliditylang.org. These should be referenced using their full URL, including `https://docs.soliditylang.org`.

I grow little of the food I eat, adn of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing.

I speak a language I did not invent or refine.

I did not discover the mathematics I use.

I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself.

When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.

I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.

I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.
